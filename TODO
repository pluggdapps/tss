* What is BOM in syntax grammar ? Should this part of string encoding or lexer ?
    BOM (EF, BB, BF) syntax is not allowed in utf-8 encoding, so where ever
        codecs.open(...).read() is used stip them off.

* This whole utf-8-sig business is very patchy. Review the code aand fix
  it properly

* charset directive should be read and based on the character-set encoding
  the whole text must be re-read. This character set encoding specified in TTL
  text must override the encoding config-param passed by the caller program.
  Intermediate python file should also adhere to this encoding.

* There is more to web-fonts than what meets the eye. Spend time understanding
  @font-face and check how TSS can help.

* CSS filter http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_filter hacks. Should we support
  them ?

* CSS3 `media-queries` for atrules to be supported.

* Compare with SCSS options with Tayra styles.

* Code generation optimization.

* Anamoly case, we are trying to do lex-analysis to gather selector context,
  by doing lookahead and the following example break,
    .alertIcon{
        width:26px;
        height:25px;
        background:transparent url('../images/alert_a_{z.png') no-repeat scroll 0 -702px;
    }

* Nested rules are to be terminated with SEMICOLON. Either get rid of this
  limitation (feature) or provide an appropriate error message.

* What kind of comments to leave and what kind of comments to prune off

* Expression substitution within a string of text
    p:before {
      content: "I ate #{5 + 10} pies!";
    }

* To provide browser compliance, `operator` non-terminal can also have,
       colon, equal, dot, gt, ask
  like,
       filter : progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(
                   startColorstr='#c2080b',endColorstr='#8c0408',
                   GradientType=0 )

* Add 'sq', 'dq' filter to expression substitution to quote the output 
  with single-quote or double-quote

* Go through http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/ and provide helper functions
  for colors.

* Allow nested @media directives inside rulesets.
  Allow nested @page directives inside rulesets.

* Separate comments from whitespace grammar `wc`. So that after AST
  transformations, comment tokens are still present in meaningful places.

* While replacing `&` in nested ruleset with parent selector, check for
  trailing whitespace after `&` and similarly strip them off from parent
  selector.
