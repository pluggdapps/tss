* What is BOM in syntax grammar ? Should this part of string encoding or lexer ?
    BOM (EF, BB, BF) syntax is not allowed in utf-8 encoding, so where ever
        codecs.open(...).read() is used stip them off.

* charset directive should be read and based on the character-set encoding

  Intermediate python file should also adhere to this encoding.

        background:transparent url('../images/alert_a_{z.png') no-repeat scroll 0 -702px;
